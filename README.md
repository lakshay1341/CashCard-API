# Cash Card API Documentation

## Introduction
This project is part of the **'Building a REST API with Spring Boot'** course from Spring Academy. The purpose of this project is to build a RESTful API for managing cash cards, implementing CRUD operations using Spring Boot. This is my first Spring Boot project, and I aim to refine my skills while applying best practices in API development.

## Project Setup
### Technologies Used
- **Java 23.0.1**
- **Spring Boot**
- **Spring Data JPA**
- **H2 Database**
- **Maven**
- **JUnit & Testcontainers**
- **Spring Security**
- **GitHub for version control**

### Running the Application
1. Clone the repository from GitHub:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/lakshay1341/CashCard-API.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory and run:
   ```sh
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
3. The application will start on `http://localhost:8080`.

## API Endpoints
### 1. Get All Cash Cards
- **Endpoint:** `GET /cashcards`
- **Description:** Retrieves all cash cards.
- **Response Example:**
  ```json
  [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "amount": 100.0,
      "owner": "lakshay"
    }
  ]
  ```

### 2. Get Cash Card by ID
- **Endpoint:** `GET /cashcards/{id}`
- **Description:** Retrieves a specific cash card by its ID.
- **Response Example:**
  ```json
  {
    "id": 1,
    "amount": 100.0,
    "owner": "lakshay"
  }
  ```

### 3. Create a Cash Card
- **Endpoint:** `POST /cashcards`
- **Description:** Creates a new cash card.
- **Request Example:**
  ```json
  {
    "amount": 200.0,
    "owner": "lakshay"
  }
  ```
- **Response Example:**
  ```json
  {
    "id": 2,
    "amount": 200.0,
    "owner": "lakshay"
  }
  ```

### 4. Update a Cash Card
- **Endpoint:** `PUT /cashcards/{id}`
- **Description:** Updates an existing cash card.
- **Request Example:**
  ```json
  {
    "amount": 250.0,
    "owner": "lakshay"
  }
  ```
- **Response Example:**
  ```json
  {
    "id": 1,
    "amount": 250.0,
    "owner": "lakshay"
  }
  ```

### 5. Delete a Cash Card
- **Endpoint:** `DELETE /cashcards/{id}`
- **Description:** Deletes a cash card by ID.
- **Response:** 204 No Content

## Spring Security Implementation
The project is secured using **Spring Security** with Basic Authentication. Only authenticated users can access the API.

### Authentication Flow:
1. User sends a request with `Basic Auth` header (`Authorization: Basic <Base64EncodedCredentials>`).
2. Spring Security intercepts the request and verifies credentials.
3. If authentication is successful, the request is processed.
4. If authentication fails, a `401 Unauthorized` response is returned.

## Testing with JUnit and Testcontainers
The project includes integration tests using JUnit and Testcontainers to validate API functionality. Tests ensure that all CRUD operations work correctly.

## Version Control with GitHub
This project is version-controlled using GitHub. The repository includes:
- Source code and configurations
- Test cases and integration tests
- Detailed documentation

                            |                     ---> Failure (401 Unauthorized)
                            ---> Success
```

### Course Overview
The course covers fundamental concepts of Spring Boot, including:
- Setting up a Spring Boot application
- Creating RESTful APIs
- Implementing CRUD operations
- Using Spring Data JPA with H2 Database
- Writing integration tests with JUnit and Testcontainers
- Securing APIs using Spring Security with Basic Authentication
- Deploying the project and managing version control with GitHub

Through this project, I have learned and applied these concepts in a real-world scenario, gaining hands-on experience with REST API development using Spring Boot.


## Conclusion
This project provided hands-on experience with Spring Boot and REST API development, reinforcing my understanding of:
- RESTful API best practices
- Spring Data JPA
- Integration testing with Testcontainers
- H2 Database for lightweight persistence
- Securing APIs using Spring Security
- Managing code with GitHub

This documentation serves as a guide for understanding and using the Cash Card API effectively.
